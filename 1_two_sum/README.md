ç”¨Hash

###Contents
<p><p>Given an array of integers, return <b>indices</b> of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.</p>
<p>You may assume that each input would have <b><i>exactly</i></b> one solution.</p>
<p>
<b>Example:</b><br/>
<pre>
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[<b>0</b>] + nums[<b>1</b>] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [<b>0</b>, <b>1</b>].
</pre>
</p>

<b><font color="red">UPDATE (2016/2/13):</font></b><br/>
The return format had been changed to <b>zero-based</b> indices. Please read the above updated description carefully.
